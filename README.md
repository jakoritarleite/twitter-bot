## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to use the software and how to install them

Packages:

```
node.js^13.5.0
npm^6.13.6
npm@get-image-colors^2.0.0,
   @googleapis^46.0.0,
   @ibm-watson^5.2.1,
   @algorithmia^0.3.10,
   @path^0.12.7,
   @twit^2.2.11
```
To install them:

```
npm i <package name>
```

### Running

Fill the files on `./credentials/*.json` with the api keys from Twitter, Google and IBM.


```
{
  "consumer_key":         "12ADS21678XkjA089",
  "consumer_secret":      "23kK13675LKJ4552L",
  "access_token":         "4J1KNN6LMKL412KL42L",
  "access_token_secret":  "214K5KMFMKL46NLHAP9"
}
```

And to run the bot

```
npm start
```



## Running the tests

To test the bot you will just need to run the follow command

* This test every function.

```
npm test
```

### Single tests

```
npm test cse
npm test watson
npm test twitter
```

What these test do ?

* This test the Google Custom Search Engine, and return you photos links.

```
npm test cse
```

* This test the Watson Visual Recognition and return you the detected things.

```
npm test watson
```

* This test the Twitter API and verify if the uploading and tweeting is working.

```
npm test twitter
```

## Deployment

To deploy it on live system is very simple, you just need to do what you've done to run in your local machine. But one thing that you'll need is an server with storage service.
